                        <p>The home/office alarm systems offer total security of buildings, differentiating all security zones. This allows for instant alert and hits at specific areas or defined zones within a building. </p>

                        <h5>Panic System</h5>
                        <p>The panic system is a manual alert system which allows user to raise alarm to response link or a control centre by the press of a button. 
                        Panic systems can however be integrated with motion detectors which would trigger initial intrusion before the panic system is activated. This system automatically alerts our Control and Monitoring Centre for response.
